            <div class="project-1-text">
                <p>I developed a responsive movie database web app that connects to a third-party API to fetch and
                    display real-time movie information. The app features a search system that allows users to find
                    movies by title and view detailed information, including plot, cast, and ratings. This project
                    demonstrates my skills in API integration, real-time data handling, and creating user-friendly
                    interfaces with Angular.

                <p>I created an e-commerce platform that organizes and displays product data based on department

                    different categories effortlessly. This project highlights my skills in API integration and creating

                <p>I developed an interactive Bubble Hit game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges
                    players to quickly find and hit a target number displayed on the screen within 30 seconds. The
                    target number changes randomly, and players must search through several bubbles, each containing a
                    different random number, to score points. This project demonstrates my ability to create engaging,
                    time-based interactive games with dynamic content and responsive design.

                    skills and attention to detail, as I created a fully responsive layout that mirrors the original
                    website. The clone includes animated elements throughout the site, enhancing user engagement and

                    to implement interactive features, providing a clear and user-friendly interface for students to
                    understand their academic performance.

The website showcases products with pagination, allowing users to filter by categories.

                    Users can add products to their cart, enhancing the shopping experience. The design is clean and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
                    
                    An admin panel is included, allowing the admin to manage productsâ€”adding, editing, or deleting them. Access to the admin panel is secured with a unique admin password.
